# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I plan to combine this project with a project for my Linear Algebra class (MATH 2101) with Professor Wallace. My idea is to create a Markov chain model of a data set, and ideally expand from there and create a webpage to summarize my results/end product.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not plan to collaborate.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I don't have any questions right now.
